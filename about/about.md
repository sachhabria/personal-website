Hello! My name is Sachin, and I'm a software developer based in the Bay Area. I'm currently a senior studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.

I've been coding for about five years now, and I'm currently working on web development projects using JavaScript, React and Python. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, photography, and organizing Spotify playlists.

Iâ€™ve developed features for millions of users on the Amazon website, and am currently building an interactive web app to visualize clothing waste in the Atacama Desert in Chile.
